I began by following Eike’s advice with the github.io page. This has led to be following the guide at https://pages.github.com/. This set me up with a site hosted out of a simple domain. From there, I set about checking more information and came across this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN6QuNqmAwk . This video is nearly 2 years old, so I wonder how out of date it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc More installation instructions here. It is much better. After messing around, I ended up installing bundler. This allowed me to make a dumb template folder in my coding directory. Then I could simply copy + paste the content into the real sites folder. It now runs on local host. 

The next hurdle was changing the directory of the links. For starters, it’s represented as x/Jekyll/update/2016/11/29/post-title.html. I find that “Jekyll/update” to be a tad redundant. Over on http://damonbauer.me/organizing-jekyll-pages/ there was some good information on how to fix that.

I have continued the research on Jekyll. While the website lives, I don’t quite understand to details of it all just yet. Today I spent time reading over the official documentation to understand the file system and the hierarchy of the folders. For this I studied https://jekyllrb.com/ the main website. I also took a look at the github repo for the default theme, minima https://github.com/jekyll/minima . 

Next, I took a look at just how to incorporate javascript into the pages for added effect.

So now that I know how to do it, the next step is to just do it, right?
